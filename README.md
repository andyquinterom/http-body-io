# http-body-io

This is a very simple crate that implements IO traits for HTTP bodies. It is
intended to be used with [tokio](https://tokio.rs) and the
[http-body](https://docs.rs/http-body/latest/http_body/) crate. This allows
you to use this crate with [hyper](https://hyper.rs) and frameworks like
[axum](https://docs.rs/axum/latest/axum/).
